==First find out what the display is called:==
   ls /sys/class/backlight/
If you have multiple displays you might see multiple devices listed. Please record down the display name (EX: acpi_video0)

==The second step is to find the max brightness:==
   sudo cat /sys/class/backlight/<display name here>/max_brightness<br />
here is the command with the example device name:
   sudo cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness

==Now edit the upBrightness.sh if statment:==
   if[ $BRIGHT -lt <MAX BRIGHTNESS HERE> ]
so if your max brightness was 24,
   if[ $BRIGHT -lt 24 ]

==Edit lines 2 and 6 to point to your video device==
aka lines: 
   BRIGHT=$(cat /sys/class/backlight/<display name here>/brightness
   echo "$bright" > /sys/class/backlight/<display name here>/brightness

==Fixing permission issues==

For these purposes, I'm assuming your username is in the users group, if the group 'users' does not exists, run the following:
   sudo groupadd users
   **Replace username with your respective username:**
   sudo useradd -G users username

For arch distributions edit /etc/rc.local:
   sudo vim /etc/rc.local
Add the following lines, replace <display name here> with your device name (as used above)
   chgrp users /sys/class/backlight/<display name here>/brightness
   chmod 764 /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness

Here are the commands for the display device acpi_video0
   chgrp users /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
   chmod 764 /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness

The reason for the 764 permission is to allow root, and all usernames in the users group to edit brightness.  The reason
for this configuration over doing a sudo whitelist..etc, is that scripts can be hacked, and they should not be blatently
'trusted'.
